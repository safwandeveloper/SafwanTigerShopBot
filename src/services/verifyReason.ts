 * ("order receiver doesn't match…"). This module maps the most
 * common reasons to longer, friendlier messages so the user
 * understands what happened and what to do next.
 *
 * Unknown reasons fall through to the raw text so we never hide
 * useful information from the user.

 *   * `'duplicate'` — the user resubmitted a hash / order id that

 *      and DON'T mark the deposit rejected (the original deposit
 *      still owns this tx).
 *   * `'reject'` — the verifier proved the tx is wrong / not a
 *      match for our address / wrong amount / wrong asset / etc.
 *      We auto-disapprove the deposit (status = `rejected`) and
 *      show the reason — no admin review needed.
 *   * `'defer'` — transient error (network blip, region block,
 *      service down) where the user's payment may well be valid;
 *      defer to admin review.
